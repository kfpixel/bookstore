Sample implmentation of a CRUD REST-API in Laravel.

Exercise: Create a Simple RESTful API for a Bookstore
Objective:
Develop a basic RESTful API for managing a bookstore. The API will allow clients to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the books.
Requirements:
* Database Setup:
    * Choose and set up a database of your preference (SQL or NoSQL). If you choose a SQL database, create a table for books. If NoSQL is your choice, create a corresponding collection.
    * Define a suitable schema for books considering typical attributes like title, author, unique identifier, etc.
* API Endpoints:
        * Implement the following RESTful endpoints:
        * GET /books - Retrieves a list of all books.
        * GET /books/:id - Retrieves a book by its ID.
        * POST /books - Adds a new book. Ensure that all necessary fields are provided in the request body.
        * PUT /books/:id - Updates the details of a specific book. The request body should allow updating relevant book attributes.
        * DELETE /books/:id - Removes the book with the specified ID.
* Data Validation:
    * Implement basic validation to ensure that necessary book attributes are provided and valid when adding or updating a book.
* Error Handling:
    * Implement basic error handling for common HTTP status codes (400 for bad requests, 404 for not found, etc.).
* Testing (If time allows):
    * Write a few basic tests to validate the functionality of the API endpoints.
